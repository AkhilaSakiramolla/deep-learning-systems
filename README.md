# ENGR-E 533 Deep Learning Systems assignments

Assignment 1:
1. MNIST classification using neural networks with PCA and tSNE for dimensionality reducation. Experimented with various hyperparameters 
like optimizers, initializers, activation functions, learning rates, etc., to study the affect on accuracy.

Assignment 3:
1. CIFAR10 classification by performing data augmentation and transfer learning to better the performance.
2. Speech denoising using LSTM.

Assignment 4:
1. Network compression using different variants of SVD without affecting the performance much.
2. Built a speaker verification system using Siamese Networks which takes two utterances as input,
and predicts whether they were spoken by the same speaker.
